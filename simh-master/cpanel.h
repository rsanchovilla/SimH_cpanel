   27-Jun-17    RSV     First version control panel support (on HP2100 family)
   10-Nov-17    RSV     control panel support for rcornwell sims IBM 7000 family
   14-May-20    RSV     Control panel support for IBM 650 use standard LIB PNG bitmaps
   27-Jan-21    RSV     Control panel support for IBM NORC mouse drag and zoom
   22-Jun-21    RSV     Control panel support for IBM 701 support for big panels, reduce cpu usage, antialise on scake < 50%

   This module implements the following routines to support control panel simulation.

   These functions are to be used on control panel implementation for computer xxx in source file 
   xxx_cpanel.c where xxx is the simulated machine (e.g. hp2100_cpanel.c)

   GetState                                (called from xxx_cpanel.c) Get single control/control array state
   SetState                                (called from xxx_cpanel.c) Set single control/control array state
   GetCArrayCId                            (called from xxx_cpanel.c) Get n'th Control Id from a Control Array

   DoClickEvent                            (called from xxx_cpanel.c) Simulates a click event on control panel
   DoSCP                                   (called from xxx_cpanel.c) Add a SCP command to pending list

   These functions are used in scp.c and xxx_cpu.c to hook control panel system in SimH. 

   cpanel_fgets                            (called from scp.c) Returns next pending scp command issued from control panel, remove from pending list 
   cpanel_interval_refresh                 (called from xxx_cpu.c) Refresh panel from within cpu inst execution loop
