; some changes from original routine stated in doc
; - use routine Q (intead of ROUTINE 2) to prints a number with 
;   decimals (AM integer part, AL fractional part)
; - use routine B (intead of ROUTINE 3) to calc square roots
; - should use index k instead of index r, because index r is 
;   destroyed on SUBROUTINE call
; - change var addrs IE to ME, :E to GE, /E to OE so var resides on a 
;   tube not overwriten by autocode generated program
; - change var addr VA to VC, so the variable is outside S0 S1 and thus
;   keeps its value even if SOUBROUTINE is used. This also implies we have
;   to remove its initialization to zero from FRACTIONS
