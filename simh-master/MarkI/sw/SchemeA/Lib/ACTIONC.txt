A/ACTION C                       Date.   8.7.52

    Purpose: To enable various actions to be performed and recorded. 
             The Key routime of the 'Formal mode'.
             (This routine replaces ACTION B)
             
    Cues: (1) $ E J O B / E Z
          (2) F A J O B / E Z
          
    Sub-routines: ENGLISH
                  OUTPUT A
                  
    Principal lines: [/A] = @ L W P
             
    Magnetic Storage: variable     Electronic Storage: S1
    
    Stores Altered: OK BK XC VC $C   B4 B5 B6
    
    Effects: Cue (1): [VC] is known as the descriptive word (DW)
             With the aid of explanatory docs it should indicate
             the action required of admisible.

             This may include altering H or the input tape or 
             setting the write-power and print punch switches; 
             also running out and tearing output tape.
             the DW must not contain @
             
             The first effect on entering the routine is that 
             ++ACTION (DW)-- is printed, preceded and followed
             by CR and LF, and an interrupted hoot occurs.
             
             The appropriate action must be taken, and the 
             completition of it indicated by operationg KAC.
             
             The H setting is then printed, followed by / and
             then [OK] is set equal to H. the link is obeyed
             
             Operationg KEC is a permissible action if H=////
             In this case, under normal circunstances INITIAL 
             is entered.
             
             Cue(2): If the printer is off, it is ussual to 
             enter by Cue(2). In this case there is no printing or 
             punching at all. The action required cannot be
             indicated by the descriptive word
             
             NOTE: differences with ACTION B
               1) The irrelevant chr printed after H is now allways /
               2) Not care for how long or at what point of hoot
                  cycle KAC is operated (This was not the case 
                  for ACTION B)
