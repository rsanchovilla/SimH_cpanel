PRINT/A                                       Date.   9.4.52
 
    Purpose: To print in fractional form the number held in A
             for use only with R.C.S/B
             
    Cues: $ $ / / N E / /    fractional signed convention
          E / / / N E / /    

          C E / / N E / /    fractional unsigned convention
          T E / / N E / /    

             
    Principal lines: [/E] = : / / S

    Electronic Storage: S0

    Stores Altered: none
                     
    Effects: 

    1. This routine us intended to be used in conjunction 
    with R.C.S/B. When the routine is called in it causes the 80
    binary digits number held in A to be printed as a fraction on
    the fractional signed or unsigned convention according to the 
    cues used.

    A carriage return and line feed is printed before any sign
    or digit

    2. If the fraction is negative a - sign is printed,
    otherwise a space is left before the number.

    3. The style of printing is specified by a 40 digit line
    (the digit layout constant) which must be sent to D before the
    routine is called in. This digit layout constant is interpreted
    as follows:

    Starting at the most significant end the digits of the
    number are examined in turn. If the r-th digit (counting the
    most significant as the 1st) is 0, then the r+1 th character
    printed is the next decimal in the fraction; if a 1, then 
    r + 1th character is a space - provided that such 1's are 
    isolated. Two consecutive 1's cause the last figure printed to 
    be followed by 2 spaces after which the routine is left.

    Examples.
       (i).  //A:#T/E  causes the number to be printed as 5 blocks
                       of 5 digits each (each block being separated
                       by a single space)

       (ii). /////A@@  causes the printing in the stype of 3 blocks, 
                       each of 4 digits. In this case the 1st 5 
                       characters are irrelevant

    4. If the cue with the lesser control number is used,
    then a carriage return and line feed occurs before printing.

    Note by Roberto Sancho: The cue dir entry has ben changed from value in
    original doc $EEZ. This value looks like the one the routine should have 
    if being used on Scheme A. Instead of this, a new cue is provided based 
    on track routine actualy has being stored to when Scheme B is built.
