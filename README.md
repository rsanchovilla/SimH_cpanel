# SimH_cpanel


**NEW!: Ferranti Mark I + R.A.Brooker Autocode + Glennie Autocode

The aim of this project is to add visuals to SimH emulator/simulator on an interactive GUI.

The visuals covers interactive control panels (lights, switches, buttons) but also
other devices: tapes, card readers, disk, etc.

IBM360 and i7000 work is based on Richard Cornwell SimH fork, modified to use cpanel modules. 
swtpc6800 work is based on Bill Beech SimH simulator.
i650, NORC, i701 and MarkI simulators are my own SimH simulators.

# Test Run Software Kits

## Common keys
Several ready to run sw kits are available to demo control panel operation (Windows only)

Hot keys are available when GUI window has the focus:
* Control E -> Halt
* Control T -> Toggles mark on clickable areas
* Control Y -> Toggles size of GUI (half size <-> full size)
* **+** (plus) and **-** (minus) keys -> Zoom In/Zoom Out (also Control + and Control -)
* Control I -> Toggle info panel 
* Control F -> Fast mode: while pressed, accelerates cpu to max speed
* Mouse:
  * Click on control panel image and drag mouse to move the window
  * Right click mouse to show a tooltip with image at 100% scale

Press power button to quit the simulator.
(On i7000 control panels, only ^E, ^Y and ^T available)
